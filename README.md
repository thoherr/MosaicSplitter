MosaicSplitter
==============

Creating HTML building instructions for LEGO mosaics.

This program splits the XML-output of the awesome PicToBrick program by Tobias Reichling and Adrian Sch√ºtz (http://www.pictobrick.de/en/pictobrick.shtml) into a bunch of HTML files, giving building instructions for smaller tiles of the mosaic.

You have to instruct PicToBrick to output 1*1 tiles or 1*1 bricks only, because MosaicSplitter expects a square pixel structure as input.

MosaicSplitter was originally written for the LEGO mosaic of Bricking Bavaria e. V. at Bricking Bavaria 2011 in Munich.

Usage
-----

Build the jar file with gradle

    gradle jar

Convert the XML of the mosaic and create the HTML instruction pages

    scala MosaicSplitter-0.4.jar <inputfile> <title> [moduleWidth [moduleHeight]]

The default for the module size is 8 * 8.

The resulting HTML files can be converted to PDF with the scripts under toe bin directory, using wkhtmltopdf (https://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/).

Building
--------

You will need the Scala programming language installed on your system. The software was written in Scala 2.9.0, which was the release available when i started the project, but the build is against the current release 2.10.2.

The build is done by gradle (http://www.gradle.org/). I use version 1.6.

Known bugs and flaws
---------------------

- The Resources (Color Jpegs, logo.jpg, mosaic.css) has to be copied to the destination directory manually (should be written by the program)
- The text in the resulting HTML files is basically hard-coded and in german.

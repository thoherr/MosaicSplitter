MosaicSplitter
==============

MosaicSplitter creates HTML building instructions for LEGO mosaics.

This program splits the XML-output of the awesome PicToBrick program by Tobias Reichling and Adrian Sch√ºtz
(http://www.pictobrick.de/en/pictobrick.shtml) into a bunch of HTML files, giving building instructions
for smaller tiles of the mosaic.

We use LEGO plates sized 16 * 16 studs and put 64 "pixels" (8 * 8) on them. Four of this plates are mounted
on a 32 * 32 base plate which form the mosaic.

You have to instruct PicToBrick to output 1 * 1 tiles or 1 * 1 bricks only, because MosaicSplitter
expects a square pixel structure as input.

MosaicSplitter was originally written for the LEGO mosaic of Bricking Bavaria e. V. at
Bricking Bavaria 2011 in Munich and reused for the LEGO mosaic at Bricking Bavaria 2013.

Usage
-----

Build the jar file with gradle

    gradle jar

Convert the XML of the mosaic and create the HTML instruction pages using the jarfile in build/libs.

    scala <path_to_build_libs>/MosaicSplitter-0.6.jar <inputfile> <title> [moduleWidth [moduleHeight]]

The default for the module size is 8 * 8 LEGO bricks. Since we use 2 * 2 bricks this creates plates
with a size of 16 * 16 studs.

The resulting HTML files can be converted to PDF with the scripts in the bin directory,
using wkhtmltopdf (https://wkhtmltopdf.org).

The bin directory contains some scripts to invoke the split (including the copy of the needed css and jpg files) and the PDF generation.

Distribution archive
--------------------

You can create a distribution ZIP file with

    gradle archive

The resulting archive in build/distribution contains everything needed to run the splitter, i. e. the scripts, the jar, logo and css file. All you need is the scala interpreter and runtime.

Building
--------

You will need the Scala programming language installed on your system.
The software was originally written in Scala 2.9.0, which was the release available when i started the project.
The current build is done with Scala release 2.12.3.

The build is done by gradle (http://www.gradle.org/). I currently use version 4.1.

Known bugs and flaws
---------------------

- The text in the resulting HTML files is basically hard-coded and in german.
